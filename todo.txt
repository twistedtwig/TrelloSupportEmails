things to think about:

if email has attachments over 10MB dont think trello will process the email.

connection failures, if it times out etc should re try infinitely or number of attempts, exponential back off?

any failure.  where should it log?  should it post to slack to say things went wrong?

try and mark the email as unread afterwards

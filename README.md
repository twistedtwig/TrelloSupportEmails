# TrelloSupportEmails
Monitor an inbox for emails and forward them to trello. Allows Trello to know WHO the email was originally from

The idea of this project is to monitor an email inbox, forward any new emails to Trello and notify a slack channel that a new Trello item will be created.

The reason this project exists is that we had the requirement that we needed to know who the email was from.  Trello has the functionality to create Cards from an email, but it only know who the email was directly from.  We would not want to use the trello email as our direct suport email, but want all emails that are sent to support to be recorded in Trello and who sent them.
